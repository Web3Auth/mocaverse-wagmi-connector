import { chain, configureChains, createClient } from 'wagmi';
import { InjectedConnector } from 'wagmi/connectors/injected';
import { publicProvider } from 'wagmi/providers/public';

const { chains, provider } = configureChains(
  [chain.mainnet, chain.polygon],
  [publicProvider()]
);

const wagmiClient = createClient({
  autoConnect: true,
  connectors: [
    new TorusConnector({ 
      chains: chains,
      options: {
        chainId: "0x1",
        host: "mainnet",
      },
    }),
